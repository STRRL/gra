# Project Overview: Gemini CLI Container Execution System

## Project Overview

This project builds a cloud-native data analytics platform that enables users to interact with S3-stored datasets through natural language queries via the Gemini CLI. The system provisions on-demand containers to execute data processing code (pandas, DuckDB, Spark) while maintaining local CLI interaction.

## Technical Goals

- **User Experience**: Seamless natural language interaction with cloud data
- **Cost Efficiency**: On-demand resource provisioning with automatic scaling
- **Performance**: Sub-5-minute container startup latency for responsive analytics
- **Scalability**: Support for 20 concurrent Gemini CLI instances with elastic scaling

## High-Level Approach

1. **Hybrid Architecture**: Local Gemini CLI orchestrates remote container execution
2. **Container-as-a-Service**: On-demand provisioning with automatic lifecycle management
3. **Storage Integration**: Dynamic S3 mounting for data access and working directory
4. **Distributed Computing**: Optional Spark cluster formation for large-scale processing

## Critical Success Factors

- Container startup latency under 5 minutes
- Reliable data synchronization between local and remote environments
- Cost-effective resource utilization through automatic pause/resume
- Extensible architecture supporting multiple data processing frameworks

## POC Priorities (1.5 Days)

- **Day 1**: Local Kubernetes setup, basic container execution
- **Day 2**: Gemini CLI integration, end-to-end demo
- **Future**: S3 integration, distributed computing, production features

## Expected POC Outcomes (1.5 Days)

- Basic demonstration of remote code execution via Gemini CLI
- Proof of concept for Kubernetes-based container orchestration
- Foundation for future development and scaling
